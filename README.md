# project-SVM-with-sklearn
You will learn the functioning and intuition behind a powerful class of supervised linear models known as support vector machines (SVMs). By the end of this project, you will be able to apply SVMs using scikit-learn and Python to your own classification tasks, including building a simple facial recognition model.
